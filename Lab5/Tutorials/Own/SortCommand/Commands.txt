cat < filename with extention > - display the contents of file
sort < filename with extention > - sort the file in asc order
sort -r < filename with extention > - sort in reverse order
sort -k < column number > < filename with extention > - Sort a file basis on a column number. By default a space is considered as seperator so characters after space is considered another column.

sort numbers
sort < filename with extention > - sort as per first digit
sort -n < filename with extention > - considers complete number
