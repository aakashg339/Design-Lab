The passage discusses the history and achievements of the West Indies cricket team. It highlights their journey from becoming the fourth Test nation in 1928 to their early successes in the 1950s under the captaincies of Frank Worrell and Gary Sobers. The team won the inaugural World Cup in 1975 and retained the title in 1979, becoming unofficial world champions throughout the 1980s. The West Indies were known for their strong bowling attack and talented batsmen during this period. However, the team's performance declined in the 1990s and 2000s due to various factors such as the failure of the West Indian Cricket Board to professionalize the sport and economic decline in West Indian countries. The team experienced a resurgence with the inception of Twenty20 cricket, winning the 2012 and 2016 World Twenty20 tournaments. The West Indies also became the first team to win the men's and women's World Twenty20 titles on the same day in 2016. The passage concludes by mentioning that the team did not qualify for the 2023 World Cup. The passage discusses the West Indian cricket team's insignia and flag. The flag consists of a palm tree and cricket stumps on a maroon background. Prior to 1999, the insignia featured a cabbage palm tree and an island, with the constellation Orion instead of the sun. The suggested motto for the West Indies team in the 1920s was "Nec curat Orion leones," meaning that Orion, symbolizing the West Indies XI, does not worry about the lions of English cricket.
