Cricket West Indies , the governing body of the team, consists of the six cricket associations of  Barbados ,  Guyana ,  Jamaica , the  Leeward Islands ,  Trinidad and Tobago , and the  Windward Islands  The  Leeward Islands Cricket Association  consists of three cricket associations from two sovereign states  one from Antigua and Barbuda, and two from Saint Kitts and Nevis , three British Overseas Territories  Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat , one U S  territory  the U S  Virgin Islands , and one Dutch constituent country  Sint Maarten  The  Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control  consists of associations of four sovereign states  Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
Two more British Overseas Territories in the region that have once been historical parts of the former West Indies Federation, the  Cayman Islands  and the  Turks and Caicos Islands , have their own national teams currently 
National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites  These national teams take part in the West Indian  first class  competition, the  Regional Four Day Competition   earlier known as the  Busta Cup ,  Shell Shield ,  Carib Beer Cup , and various other names 91 15 93  It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm up games before they take on the combined West Indies team 
The combined population of these countries and territories is around 6 million people, comparable to fellow Full Members  New Zealand  and  Ireland , and prominent Associate Member  Scotland

The history of the West Indies cricket team began in the 1890s, when the first representative sides were selected to play visiting  English  sides  The WICB joined the sport s international ruling body, the  Imperial Cricket Conference , in 1926, 91 16 93  and played their first official international match, granted  Test  status, in 1928, 91 17 93  thus becoming the fourth Test  nation  In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies that would later form the  West Indies Federation  plus  British Guiana 
The last series the West Indies played before the outbreak of the  Second World War  was against England in 1939  There followed a hiatus that lasted until January 1948 when the MCC toured the West Indies 91 18 93  Of the West Indies players in that first match after the war only  Gerry Gomez ,  George Headley ,  Jeffrey Stollmeyer , and  Foffie Williams  had previously played Test cricket 91 19 93  In 1948, leg spinner  Wilfred Ferguson  became the first West Indian bowler to take ten wickets in a Test, finishing with 11 229 in a match against England 91 20 93  later that same year  Hines Johnson  became the first West Indies fast bowler to achieve the feat, managing 10 96 against the same opponents 91 21 93 
The West Indies defeated England for the first time at  Lord s  on 29 June 1950  Ramadhin and Alf Valentine were the architects of the victory which inspired a calypso by Lord Beginner  Later on 16 August 1950, completed a 3 1 series win when they won at  The Oval  Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test team, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white dominated to a black dominated side under the successive captaincies of  Frank Worrell  and  Gary Sobers 
The team won the  inaugural World Cup  in England in 1975, and retained the title in  1979 91 22 93  By the late 1970s, the West Indies led by  Clive Lloyd  had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputation they retained throughout the 1980s 91 23 93  During these glory years, the West Indies were noted for their four man  fast bowling  attack, backed up by some of the best  batsmen  in the world  In 1976, fast bowler  Michael Holding  took 14 149 in the OvalTest against England, setting a record which still stands for best bowling figures in a Test by a West Indies bowler 91 24 93 91 25 93  The 1980s saw the team set a then record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984 and inflict two 5 0  blackwashes  on England 
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, largely owing to the failure of the West Indian Cricket Board to move the game from an amateur pastime to a professional sport, coupled with the general economic decline in West Indian countries, and the team struggling to retain its past glory  Victory in the 2004 Champions Trophy and a runner up showing in the 2006 Champions Trophy left some hopeful, but it was not until the inception of  Twenty20  cricket that the West Indies began to regain a place among the cricketing elite and among cricket fans, as they developed ranks of players capable of taking over games with their power hitting, including  Chris Gayle ,  Kieron Pollard ,  Marlon Samuels ,  Lendl Simmons ,  DJ Bravo ,  Andre Russell  and  Carlos Brathwaite  They beat Australia and then host Sri Lanka in the  2012 World Twenty20  to win their first ICC world championship since the 1979 World Cup and then bested England to win the  2016 World Twenty20 , making them the first team to win the World Twenty20 twice  As an added bonus, the West Indies also became the first to win both the men s and women s World Twenty20 on the same day, as the women s team beat three time defending champion Australia for their first ICC world title immediately beforehand  For the first time in the history of the tournament, the team did not qualify for the  2023 World Cup  after losing to  Scotland  in the  Super Six stage of the Qualifiers 91 22 93 
Most cricketing nations use their own national flags for cricketing purposes  However, as the West Indies represent a number of independent states and dependencies, there is no natural choice of flag  The WICB has, therefore, developed an insignia showing a palm tree and cricket stumps on a small sunny island  see the top of this article  The insignia, on a maroon background, makes up the West Indian flag  The background sometimes has a white stripe above a green stripe, which is separated by a maroon stripe, passing horizontally through the middle of the background 91 26 93  Prior to 1999, the WICB C  had used a  similar insignia  featuring a  cabbage palm  tree and an island, but there were no stumps and, instead of the sun, there was the  constellation Orion  It was designed in 1923 by Sir Algernon Aspinall, then Secretary of the  West India Committee 91 27 93  Around the same time in the 1920s the suggested motto for the West Indies team was  Nec curat Orion leones , which comes from a quote by  Horace , meaning that Orion, as symbolical of the West Indies XI, does not worry about the lions  of English cricket 91 28 93
