The West Indies men's cricket team, also known as The Windies, represents the English-speaking countries and territories in the Caribbean region. The team is administered by Cricket West Indies and is made up of players selected from fifteen Caribbean nations. Currently, the West Indies cricket team is ranked eighth in Tests, tenth in ODIs, and seventh in T20Is according to the ICC rankings. In the past, the West Indies team was considered the strongest in the world from the 1970s to the 1990s. Many legendary cricketers from the West Indies have been inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. The West Indies team has achieved success in several international tournaments, including winning the Cricket World Cup twice. They have also hosted major cricket events such as the 2007 Cricket World Cup and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The team is governed by Cricket West Indies, which consists of cricket associations from various Caribbean nations. Additionally, there are national teams representing individual islands, which participate in the regional tournaments. The combined population of the countries and territories represented by the West Indies cricket team is approximately 6 million people. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 and became the fourth Test nation in 1928. In their early days, the team represented British colonies and later the West Indies Federation and British Guiana. They played their last series before World War II against England in 1939 and didn't play again until 1948. The West Indies defeated England for the first time in 1950 and went on to win the inaugural World Cup in 1975 and retain the title in 1979. Throughout the 1980s, the West Indies had a dominant team with strong batsmen and a four-man fast bowling attack. However, their performance declined in the 1990s and 2000s due to various reasons, including economic decline and the failure to professionalize the game. They experienced a resurgence in the Twenty20 format, winning the World Twenty20 in 2012 and 2016. The team also became the first to win both the men's and women's World Twenty20 on the same day in 2016. However, they did not qualify for the 2023 World Cup. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has developed an insignia for the West Indian flag, which consists of a palm tree and cricket stumps on a small sunny island. The insignia is on a maroon background, sometimes with a white stripe above a green stripe, separated by a maroon stripe in the middle. Previously, the WICB used a similar insignia in 1999, featuring a cabbage palm tree and an island, without stumps and with the constellation Orion instead of the sun. This older insignia was designed in 1923 by Sir Algernon Aspinall. There was also a suggested motto for the West Indies team in the 1920s, which translates to "Orion, as symbolic of the West Indies XI, does not worry about the lions of English cricket."
