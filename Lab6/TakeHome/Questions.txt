For query1
Should we consider the 
1. Each day the node pair chatted atleast 10 times
2. In 10 days together, the pair chatted atleast 10 times.

For query2
Lin1 - For ‬‭K ‬‭in ‬‭5 ‬‭to ‬‭20‬ ‭at increments‬ ‭of‬ ‭5
By the above line does it mean that we dynamically randomly select k value to be 5, 10, 15 or 20 or we can select any value of k from 5,10,15,20 and hardcode it.
